# BooksList website
BooksList is a website that allows you to keet track i=of the books you have read and want to read. You can add the books you have read to a list and even rate them on how good they are. You can also list down the books you want to read and write a brief description on what the book is about. This website also has a section where it recommends some booksaccording to gender.

# Design Process
I made my website to be easy to navigate around, where all the pages are connected, so that users can just go from one page to another with just a click. 
* For people who like to read, this website allows them to organise the books they have read and and want to read, and they can do it digitally, this can help users keep track of the books they have and can reference back anytime.

# Features
These features are the features in the website and not the wireframe as both has some small differences that I have stated in my video pesentation.
* "+ New book" button - allows users to add a new row to the table and enter the name of the book they want to add.
* "Edit" button - allows users click on a row to edit anything from that row.
* "Remove" button - allows users to remove the row they have selected.
* Hyperlink on books - sllows users to click on a book and be directed to the book on Amazon.

## Features Left to Implement
Search - allows users to search for any book
